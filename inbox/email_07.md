Morning team,

I was on the train browsing on my phone this morning when I found a website where some of the text was animated and it 
looked so cool! Can we try some animation on the main heading of the website? Maybe make it bounce?

## Tips

Tailwind comes with some pre-defined animations out of the box, see what comes up when you type: "animate-"
