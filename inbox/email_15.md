Hi Team,

Do you think we could add a NavBar to the website at the top? We could use it to open up parts of the website and 
add additional functionality.

## Tips

There's already a pre-made [Navbar](../src/components/NavBar.jsx) in the Components folder. Can you see how you would import it into the layout of the website?

Look at [email_08.md](./email_08.md) to see how we imported a NavBar component.
