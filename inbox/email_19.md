Hi Team,

All of our users are from the UK, we have an American spelling that needs to be changed to British spelling in the navigation bar.

## Tips
In [NavBar.jsx](../src/components/NavBar.jsx), look for the object called Tabs.

An object contains properties in the format key: "value".

Changing the value will update what is displayed on the screen.
