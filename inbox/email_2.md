Morning Team,

Was having a brainstorm with the rest of the team last night. We decided a great name for the site should be MDB
(it's a play on IMDB you see?)


## Tips

There's a handy object exported from [Navbar](../src/components/NavBar.jsx) which is used throughout the application to set the titles on the website.
A quick change there should do the trick...
