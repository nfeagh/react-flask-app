Hi Team,

The icon to favourite movies is misleading, let's change it from a red heart to a gold star.

## Tips

Look at [FavouriteIcon.jsx](../src/components/FavouriteIcon.jsx),

- When a movie isn't in favourite's, it should be outlined 
- When a movie is in favourites, it should be filled.

Go to [this](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) website and look for 2 Star icons (one outlied and one filled). 

Click on the icon for a guide on how to import them.
