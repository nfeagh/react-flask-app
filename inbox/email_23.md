Hi Team,

Users are complaining they can't find the movie they are looking for. I think our database is not good enough. I'm going to do some research and get back to you.

## Tips

Make sure the flask backend service is running.

Go to [MainPage.jsx](../src/pages/MainPage.jsx) and uncomment line 25 to 27.

Remember to remove the search functionality we added in [email_21](email_21.md).

Go to the [next](../inbox/email_24.md) email.
