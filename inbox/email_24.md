Hi Team,

I have bought access to OMDB API to make our search functionality better.

The API key is **MjY1MWIwZGI=** 

I have encrypted the password, make sure to decrypt it!

## Tips

A "key" is also known as a password. It is important you don't leak keys as hackers could do bad things with them. The best thing to do when you leak a key is to disable it and generate a new one.

This specific key allows us to connect to **The Open Movie Database** (OMDb) which is a database that has loads of different movies.

To decrypt the password, use [this](https://www.base64decode.org/) website.

Look at [api.py](../api/api.py) and figure out where to add the key.
