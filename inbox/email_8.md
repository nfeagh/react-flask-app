Hey team,

Could we try adding a NavBar - but we don't want it to detract from the look and feel of the site, so can we stick it at the bottom?

## Tips

There's already a pre-made [Navbar](../src/components/NavBar.jsx) in the Components folder. Can you see how you would import it into the layout of the website?
