Hi Team,

I think we could make better use of the real estate on the page. Can we increase the number of films we can see on a row

## Tips

On the MainPage.jsx, look for this line:

    <div className="grid grid-cols-1">

This specifies that the layout of the movies should be in a grid format, with 1 column
