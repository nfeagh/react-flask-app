Hi Team,

Our users have started sending in requests to understand whether the movie is rated G, PG... And they also want some more information on how long the movie is. Could you take a look and see if it is possible to display these details?

## Tips
Take a look at the [mocked movie details](../src/mocks/movieDetails.js) to see if further details are available and what information is relevant to fulfil this request.

This needs to be added to the [MovieDetails](../src/components/MovieDetails.jsx) component
