Hi Team,

I'm not sure I like the text being to the right of the movie. Can we try having it below the movie poster?

## Tips

On the MovieCard.jsx, look for this line:

    <div className="self-center flex items-center">

Flex is a css layout and its affect here is to put the children of the movie card container next to one another.
By default, if not specified, each child component of the parent would take up the entire width of the parent container.
