Hi Team,

Our users have started sending in requests to understand whether the movie is rated G, PG..... and they also want some more information on how long the movie is. Could you take a look and see if it is possible to display these details?

## Tips
Check the [api call](https://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0076759&plot=full&apikey=2651b0db&plot) being made for a movie with id=tt0076759 and see if these details are available.


Alternatively, you can inspect the requests sent to the server when a movie details are displayed to find out all the details available. We only display some of them!
